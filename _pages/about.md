I am Biomedical Engineer graduated from University of Isfahan. Later, I joined Bogazici University for my graduate studied. I have a wide background in BME where I tried to explore different aspects of the field before settling in for a specific topic. That gave me a multidiciplinary view. I started research in my undergraduate years with Finite Element Methods (FEM) in Biomechanics. I studied the biomechanics of the atherosclerosis in coronary arteries. I also participated in a Tissue Engineering project where we studied the effects of mechanical loading on the cell differentiation. Later I obtained my MSc. on biomaterials where I worked with shape memory alloys (SMA) and actuators. Now I am a PhD candidate in Bogazici University, Institute of Biomedical Engineering. I work on Metamaterials and their applications in MRI. I am also a R&D engineer in Glakolens startup company.


<!---Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
